Due to the huge size of the datasets, I couldn't upload them to my repo in GitHub. Here is how to download it:
1. First go the this website:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/overview
2. Then go to the data section there
3. Download that data
4. Put the data in this directory: static/data/processData
6. Run the notebooks as you want.
